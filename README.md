# HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React Projects

As part of my learning journey to master HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and React, I have developed several small projects. These projects cover a range of topics, including pure JavaScript functionality and specific applications focusing on integrating React with Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

To get started with any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anokris04/Small-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Small-Projects
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
